On **March 20, 2025**, Burners Without Borders community members gathered at **Burning Man Global HQ** for the first **Cyberpony Express Workshop**.

This workshop was a collaboration with [The High Desert Institute](https://highdesertinstitute.org/) and [The Multiverse School](https://themultiverse.school/). We were very overwhelmed by the number of people who showed up. It was standing room only in the thunderdome.

## What We Covered

* **What:** LoRa hardware
* **How:** Meshtastic software
* **Why:** Cyberpony Express - a project to build a low-cost, open-source, long-range communication network as an alternative to cell phone networks and the internet.

## Why It Mattered

We discussed the need for a rugged, easy-to-use communication system that can operate independently of traditional infrastructure. This is especially important in disaster scenarios where cell towers and internet connectivity may be compromised.

## How

Participants got hands-on experience with LoRa devices, learning how to set them up and use the Meshtastic software to create a mesh network. We also talked about potential future integrations into the other projects of the High Desert Institute and Multiverse School, including robotics, community AI labs, and off-grid digital libraries.
