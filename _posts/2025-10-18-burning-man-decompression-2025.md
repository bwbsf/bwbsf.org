excerpt: Recap of our Meshtastic booth, dashboard demo, and community mesh talks at Burning Man Decompression 2025.
---
On **Saturday, October 18, 2025**, we participated in **Burning Man Decompression 2025**.

We hosted a booth where we gave out dozens of free Meshtastic nodes and debuted our first Meshtastic dashboard demonstration. The demo illustrated a community-accessible screen showing the contents of conversations happening on the mesh.

This allows people without personal access to the mesh to see what is happening and understand the value of joining the network. 

Some options for extending the community dashboard:
- A bulletin board service
- A simple chat but with knowledge about the group hosting the dashboard (such as the event calendar for a Burning Man camp, details about programs offered by a nonprofit, etc)
- The gps location of the group hosting the dashboard so that members of the public can come visit

SF Co-Chair **CJ Trowbridge** and new SF Co-Chair **Frank Cohen** also gave speeches about our work building a massive 10,000-person mesh at Burning Man this year.
