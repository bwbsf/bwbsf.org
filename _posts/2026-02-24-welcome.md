excerpt: Launching the new chapter website with a shared homepage, blog, and GitHub Pages publishing workflow.

This is the initial post for the new Burners Without Borders SF Bay Area website.

We are starting with a GitHub Pages and Jekyll setup so the chapter can publish updates quickly with a simple Markdown workflow.

Use future posts for:

* project announcements
* volunteer calls
* event recaps
* after-action notes
* requests for collaboration

As the chapter's needs become clearer, this site can expand with additional pages for projects, resources, and contact information.
